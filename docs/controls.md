## Control Center

Open the Control Center with `SUPER + Tab`. Its four areas provide:

- **Connection:** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- **Audio and display:** output selection, volume, mute, and per-monitor brightness
- **Quickshare:** send or receive files using HTTP and QR codes
- **Notifications:** history, actions, Do Not Disturb, and Clear All

See the [Quickshare guide](quickshare.md) for transfer steps, limits, and
network-safety information.

Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or the arrow keys to move. Press `Enter` or `Space` to
open the selected item, and press `Esc` to go back or close the menu.

From the center, press a direction to open that side. Inside a panel, use the
same keys to move through its controls.

Choose Brightness to adjust the monitor where the Control Center opened. Drag
or scroll over the slider, or use the left and right keys. Each monitor keeps
its own level for the current login session.

## Quick notes

`SUPER + N` opens the standalone drawer on the focused monitor. Pressing it
again closes it. From another monitor it moves the same drawer
there without changing your note. Escape, the top-right × button, or clicking outside
the drawer closes it.

Opening and closing use the shared red illustrated curtain.
The red hover and selection animations inside the note list are independent.

Choose `+ NEW NOTE`, then type a title and body. Rows use `01// title`
numbering. The selected row stays red; choosing another row lets the previous
row's fill retract. Use the separate X to delete a note and `UNDO` to restore
the last deletion. Undo survives closing the drawer, but ends when the shell
restarts.

Edits save automatically. `SAVING` means a write is pending; `SAVED` means the
latest edit has been acknowledged by storage. `SAVE FAILED` keeps your draft
in memory and offers Retry. Wait for `SAVED` before restarting the shell.

The COPY button beside the save status copies only the note body, not its title.

Notes are stored as private, unencrypted text at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/tsugumori/notes.json`, or
`~/.local/share/tsugumori/notes.json` when that variable is unset. Notes do not
belong to the installed config or the Git repository.

The drawer uses the existing `Settings.scale`. Set
`TSUGUMORI_REDUCED_MOTION=1` in the desktop shell's launch environment to make
the drawer and row/button fill changes immediate. No new Settings fields are
required.

## Clipboard history

`SUPER + C` opens the clipboard drawer on the focused monitor. Press it again
to close, or use it on another monitor to move the drawer there. Escape and
the top-right × button also close it.

Search copied text and links, preview images, or filter to pinned entries.
Use the arrow keys to select an entry and `Ctrl + F` to focus search. Press
`Enter` from the search field or history list, or choose `USE`, to restore
the entry to the clipboard and close the drawer. Paste it in your application
as usual.

Pin entries to keep them out of automatic history cleanup. Delete removes one
entry; Clear removes unpinned history after confirmation. `UNDO` restores
the latest deletion for 30 seconds.

History is stored locally in an unencrypted database at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/tsugumori/clipboard/history.sqlite3`, or
`~/.local/share/tsugumori/clipboard/history.sqlite3` when that variable is
unset. This data is not part of the configuration or repository.

Set `clipboardDark: true` in `Settings.qml` for the charcoal palette.
The default is the light notification-style palette. Upgrades preserve your
existing Settings file, so add `readonly property bool clipboardDark: false`
if it is missing.

## Lock screen power controls

The bottom-right RESTART and SHUT DOWN buttons require a second press to
confirm. Choose CANCEL or press Escape to cancel. A failed power request leaves
the session locked and allows another password attempt. System permissions
determine whether shutdown or restart is available.
